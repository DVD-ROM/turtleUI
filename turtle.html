        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <b>forward(50) | fd(50) </b>
        <p>
          Moves the turtle forward 50 steps. You can change the number to make
          it move more or less.
        </p>
        <b> backward(50) | back(50) | bk(50) </b>
        <p>
          Moves the turtle backward 50 steps, but still facing forward. You can
          change the number to make it move more or less.
        </p>
        <b> right(30) | rt(30) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle turn right 30 degrees. You can change the number to
          make it turn more or less. 180 degrees is turning half a circle. 90
          degrees is turning half of that! 0 degrees is no turn.
        </p>
        <b> left(30) | lt(30) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle turn left 30 degrees. You can change the number to
          make it turn more or less. 180 degrees is turning half a circle. 90
          degrees is turning half of that! 0 degrees is no turn. 0 degrees is no
          turn.
        </p>
        <b> penup() | penUp() | up() | pu() </b>
        <p>
          Lifts the turtle off the paper so that it doesn't draw when it moves.
        </p>
        <b> pendown() | penDown() | down() | pd() </b>
        <p>Puts the turtle on the paper so that it draws when it moves.</p>
        <b> hideturtle() | hideTurtle() | ht() </b>
        <p>Hides the turtle. It can still draw, but it isn't shown.</p>
        <b> showturtle() | showTurtle() | st() </b>
        <p>Shows the turtle.</p>
        <b> home() </b>
        <p>
          Moves the turtle to its home in the center (x = 0, y = 0) and pointing
          to the top (angle = 0)
        </p>
        <b> clear() </b>
        <p>Erases everything, but leaves the turtle where it is.</p>
        <b> reset() </b>
        <p>
          Erases everything and moves the turtle to its home in the center (x =
          0, y = 0) and pointing to the top (angle = 0)
        </p>
        <b> goto(30, 40) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle teleport to the place 30 steps right from the center
          and 40 steps up from the center. In other words, the place where x =
          30, y = 40. You can change the number of steps! To make the turtle
          teleport to a place left from the center, add a negative sign - to the
          first number, like this: goto(-30, 40) To make the turtle teleport to
          a place down from the center, add a negative sign - to the second
          number, like this: goto (30, -40)
        </p>
        <b> setx(30) | setX(30) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle teleport to 30 steps right from the center, without
          changing how up or how down it is. To make the turtle teleport to a
          place left from the center, add a negative sign - to the number, like
          this: setx(-30)
        </p>
        <b> sety(40) | setY(40) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle teleport to 40 steps up from the center, without
          changing how left or how right it is. To make the turtle teleport to a
          place down from the center, add a negative sign - to the number, like
          this: sety(-40)
        </p>
        <b> angle(90) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle point east. You can change the number to change the
          direction the turtle faces. 0 is North, 90 is East, 180 is South, 270
          is West.
        </p>
        <b> width(6) | pensize(6) </b>
        <p>
          Changes the thickness of the turtle's pen to 6. You can change the
          number to make the width thicker or thinner.
        </p>
        <b> color("red") </b>
        <p>
          Changes the color of the turtle's pen to red. You can change it to
          another color, just remember to write it inside double quotation
          marks, like this: "green". There are actually hundreds of colors you
          can choose! Talk to us if you need help finding a color.
        </p>
        <b> curveright(5, 180) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle draw part of a circle by turning right. Change the
          first number to control how far away the circle should be. Change the
          second number to control how much of the circle to draw. In the
          example above, the turtle draws half a circle 5 steps away.
        </p>
        <b> curveleft(5, 180) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle draw part of a circle by turning left. Change the
          first number to control how far away the circle should be. Change the
          second number to control how much of the circle to draw. In the
          example above, the turtle draws half a circle 5 steps away.
        </p>
        <b> dot(5) </b>
        <p>
          Makes the turtle draw a dot that's 5 pixels thick. Change the number
          to make the dot bigger or smaller!
